# First Web Development Project: Contact Form

## Project Overview
This project represents my first dive into frontend development. I built a functional "Contact Miles" form to practice using semantic HTML elements and form inputs.

## Technical Features
* **Form Handling:** Implemented inputs for Username, Phone, Email, and Messages.
* **Structure:** Used HTML tags like `<label>`, `<form>`, and `<center>` to organize content.

## Learning Journey
As this was my first project, the code reflects my initial learning stage. My next steps involve:
* Moving from inline styling to external **CSS3** files for better organization.
* Learning how to replace `<center>` tags with modern CSS Flexbox or Grid.
* Cleaning up code nesting to improve readability.
